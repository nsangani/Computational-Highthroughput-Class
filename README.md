# Computational-Highthroughput-Class
All the scripts from various highthroughput assingments 

# Assignment 1
Pearson correlations between every pair columns </br>
Correlations matrix heatmap

# Assignment 2
Transcript half lives using 60 minute time series data </br>
Average of the three calculated half lives for each transcript </br>
Identify the genes/transcripts with very high (top 10%) and very low (bottom 10%) half lives and perform a simple functional enrichment analysis using GO annotations

# Assignment 3
Predict the operons using ptt files </br>
Predict the operons using gff files

# Assignment 4
Compute position weighted matrix (PWM) or Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSS) </br>
Identify the binding sites in the attached set of upstream regulatory regions of genes by filtering to those with highest similarity to the PSM

# Assignment 5
Calculate the degree and clustering coefficient for every node (protein) in the human protein interaction network  </br>
Plot the degree distribution to test for scale-free structure  </br>
Calculate the shortest path lengths between every pair of nodes  </br>
Compare the path length distributions between the two protein sets using a wilcox test

# Final Coding Exam
Compute the di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide frequency (both absolute and percentage) of the nucleotides present in the original RNA sequences  </br>
Compare the differences in the percentage abundance of a dinucleotide and trinucleotide composition between the two sequences (in the fasta files) to identify those, which differ by three fold (3X times) in percentage between pairs of sequences
